# Day Tour Auto-Checkout Implementation

## Overview
This implementation automatically checks out day tour bookings at 6pm (18:00) since day tours are only valid from 8am to 6pm. The system monitors all checked-in day tour bookings and automatically changes their status to "checked_out" when the time reaches 6pm.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Checkout at 6pm
- **Time Monitoring**: System checks every minute for day tour bookings that need to be checked out
- **Automatic Status Update**: Changes booking status from "completed" to "checked_out" at 6pm
- **Real-time Notifications**: Shows notifications when guests are automatically checked out
- **Database Update**: Updates the booking record with auto-checkout information

### 2. Visual Indicators in Clerk Interface
- **Color-coded Cards**: Day tour bookings show different colors based on checkout time
- **Time Remaining Display**: Shows countdown to 6pm checkout time
- **Status Indicators**: 
  - Green: Normal day tour (checkout at 6pm)
  - Orange: Within 30 minutes of checkout time
  - Red: Past checkout time (overdue)

### 3. Manual Override Options
- **Force Checkout Button**: Appears for overdue day tours to manually check them out
- **Manual Checkout**: Staff can still manually check out guests before 6pm
- **Testing Tools**: Development tools for testing the auto-checkout functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions

#### `startDayTourAutoCheckout()`
- Initializes the auto-checkout monitoring system
- Sets up interval to check every minute
- Runs initial check when function is called

#### `checkAndAutoCheckoutDayTours()`
- Main function that handles the auto-checkout logic
- Checks current time and only proceeds if it's 6pm or later
- Filters for day tour bookings that are still checked in
- Updates booking status and adds auto-checkout note
- Refreshes the checkout list if currently visible

### Auto-Checkout Logic

```javascript
// Check if it's 6pm or later
const now = new Date();
const currentTime = now.getHours() * 60 + now.getMinutes();
const sixPM = 18 * 60;

if (currentTime < sixPM) {
    return; // Not yet 6pm
}

// Find day tour bookings that need checkout
const dayTourBookings = bookingsData.filter(booking => {
    return booking.status === 'completed' && 
           booking.notes?.includes('daytour') &&
           booking.bookingDate;
});

// Auto-checkout each booking
for (const booking of dayTourBookings) {
    // Update status to checked_out
    // Add auto-checkout note
    // Show notification
}
```

### Visual Indicators

#### Time-based Styling
- **Normal (Green)**: Day tours with checkout time > 30 minutes away
- **Warning (Orange)**: Day tours within 30 minutes of checkout
- **Overdue (Red)**: Day tours past 6pm checkout time

#### Status Messages
- "At 6:00 PM" - Normal day tour
- "In X minutes" - Approaching checkout time
- "OVERDUE - Will auto-checkout" - Past checkout time

## User Experience

### For Staff (Clerk Interface)
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: See all checked-in guests with clear day tour indicators
2. **Time Awareness**: Know when day tours are approaching checkout time
3. **Manual Control**: Can manually check out guests before 6pm if needed
4. **Notifications**: Receive alerts when guests are automatically checked out

### For Day Tour Guests
1. **Clear Expectations**: Day tour time limits are clearly communicated
2. **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed at checkout time
3. **Consistent Policy**: All day tours follow the same 6pm checkout rule

## Implementation Details

### Database Updates
When a day tour is auto-checked out:
- Status changes from "completed" to "checked_out"
- Notes field is updated with "Auto-checked out at 6pm (day tour)"
- All other booking information remains unchanged

### Real-time Updates
- Socket.IO integration ensures real-time updates across all connected clients
- Checkout list automatically refreshes when auto-checkout occurs
- Notifications appear immediately when guests are checked out

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network errors during auto-checkout
- Logging of all auto-checkout attempts and results
- Fallback mechanisms if automatic checkout fails

## Testing and Development

### Testing Tools
- **Manual Trigger**: `window.testAutoCheckout()` in console (development only)
- **Test Button**: Hidden button for testing auto-checkout functionality
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

### Development Features
- Test button only appears on localhost/development environments
- Console access to toggle test button visibility
- Detailed logging of all auto-checkout operations

## Configuration

### Timing Configuration
- **Check Interval**: Every 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Checkout Time**: 6:00 PM (18:00) - hardcoded for day tours
- **Warning Time**: 30 minutes before checkout (configurable)

### Visual Configuration
- **Warning Threshold**: 30 minutes before checkout
- **Color Schemes**: 
  - Green: #27ae60 (normal)
  - Orange: #f39c12 (warning)
  - Red: #e74c3c (overdue)

## Benefits

1. **Operational Efficiency**: No manual intervention needed for day tour checkouts
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Ensures consistent 6pm checkout for all day tours
3. **Staff Awareness**: Clear visual indicators help staff manage day tours
4. **Guest Experience**: Smooth, automated checkout process
5. **Data Integrity**: Consistent booking status management

## Future Enhancements

- **Configurable Times**: Allow different checkout times for different cottage types
- **SMS Notifications**: Send reminders to guests before auto-checkout
- **Grace Period**: Allow configurable grace period after 6pm
- **Analytics**: Track auto-checkout patterns and timing
- **Mobile Notifications**: Push notifications to staff devices

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging
- All auto-checkout operations are logged to console
- Failed auto-checkouts are logged with error details
- Success notifications include guest names and timestamps

### Performance
- Lightweight monitoring (checks every minute)
- Efficient filtering of day tour bookings
- Minimal impact on system performance

### Troubleshooting
- Console logs provide detailed debugging information
- Manual trigger available for testing
- Clear error messages for failed operations

# Reject Booking 500 Error Fix

## Problem
The `/api/bookings/:id/reject` endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to reject pending bookings. This was preventing the cleanup functionality from working properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Booking model's `reject` method. The method was trying to use fields that didn't exist in the database schema:

1. **Missing `rejectionReason` field**: The method was using `cancellationReason` for rejections
2. **Missing `rejectedAt` field**: The method was using `cancelledAt` for rejections
3. **Inconsistent field usage**: Rejections and cancellations were sharing the same fields

## Solution

### 1. Added Missing Schema Fields
Added the following fields to the Booking schema in `backend/models/Booking.js`:

```javascript
rejectionReason: {
  type: String,
  maxlength: [200, 'Rejection reason cannot exceed 200 characters']
},
rejectedAt: {
  type: Date
}
```

### 2. Fixed the Reject Method
Updated the `reject` method to use the correct fields:

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
this.cancellationReason = reason || 'Booking rejected by staff';
this.cancelledAt = new Date();

// After (correct)
this.rejectionReason = reason || 'Booking rejected by staff';
this.rejectedAt = new Date();
```

### 3. Updated Pre-save Middleware
Added automatic timestamp setting for rejected bookings:

```javascript
if (this.isModified('status') && this.status === 'rejected' && !this.rejectedAt) {
  this.rejectedAt = new Date();
}
```

### 4. Updated Validation
Added validation for the new `rejectionReason` field in `backend/middleware/bookingValidation.js`.

## Testing
A test script `test-reject-fix.js` was created to verify the fix works correctly.

## Impact
- ✅ Reject booking functionality now works properly
- ✅ Cleanup functions can successfully reject pending bookings
- ✅ Proper separation between cancellations and rejections
- ✅ Automatic timestamp tracking for rejections

## Files Modified
1. `backend/models/Booking.js` - Added missing fields and fixed reject method
2. `backend/middleware/bookingValidation.js` - Added validation for rejectionReason
3. `test-reject-fix.js` - Test script to verify the fix
4. `REJECT_BOOKING_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the backend changes
2. Test the cleanup functionality in the clerk interface
3. Verify that pending bookings can be properly rejected
4. Monitor for any remaining issues

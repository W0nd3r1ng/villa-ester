## How It Works

### Scoring System (100 points total)
- **Popularity Score** (30 points): Based on booking frequency
- **Rating Score** (25 points): Based on average guest ratings
- **Guest Fit Score** (25 points): How well cottage capacity matches guest count
- **Special Occasion Bonus** (20 points): Extra points for celebrations and special requests

### Special Request Detection

- **Party**: "party", "celebration", "gathering", "event"
- **Videoke**: "videoke", "karaoke", "singing", "music"
- **Anniversary**: "anniversary", "wedding anniversary"

## Usage

### From Node.js Backend
```javascript
// The backend automatically calls the Python script
// when recommendations are requested via API
GET /api/recommendations?guest_count=4&booking_date=2024-01-15&special_requests=birthday
```

### Direct Python Usage
```python
from simple_recommender import SimpleCottageRecommender

recommender = SimpleCottageRecommender()
recommender.load_data(cottages, bookings, reviews)

recommendations = recommender.recommend_cottages(
    guest_count=4,
    booking_date='2024-01-15',
    special_requests='Birthday celebration with videoke'
)
```

## Example Output
```json
[
  {
    "cottage_id": "ve_cottage",

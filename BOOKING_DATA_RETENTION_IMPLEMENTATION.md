# Booking Data Retention Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows users to retain their search data from the availability form when clicking "Book Now" on available cottages. Users no longer need to re-enter their booking type, guest count, and dates when proceeding to book a specific cottage.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Retention
- **Booking Type**: Day Tour or Overnight Stay selection is carried over
- **Guest Count**: Number of guests is transferred to the "Adults" field
- **Dates**: 
  - For Day Tour: Schedule date is pre-filled
  - For Overnight: Check-in and check-out dates are pre-filled
- **Cottage Type**: Automatically selected based on the cottage chosen

### 2. Smart Form Management
- **Personal Information Cleared**: Name, email, phone, special requests, and proof of payment are cleared to ensure fresh data entry
- **Visual Feedback**: Green notification appears when data is successfully carried over
- **Form Validation**: Maintains all existing validation rules

### 3. User Experience Enhancements
- **Smooth Transition**: No interruption in the booking flow
- **Clear Indication**: Users know their data has been preserved
- **Consistent Behavior**: Works across all "Book Now" buttons (cottage cards, AI recommendations)

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions

#### `openBookingModal(cottageId, cottageType)`
- Added call to `clearModalPersonalInfo()` to clear personal data
- Added call to `prefillBookingModalFromAvailabilityForm()` to carry over search data
- Maintains existing cottage type mapping and selection

#### `clearModalPersonalInfo()`
- Clears only personal information fields:
  - Full name
  - Phone number
  - Email address
  - Special requests
  - Children count
  - Proof of payment file and preview

#### `prefillBookingModalFromAvailabilityForm()`
- Retrieves data from availability form
- Pre-fills booking modal fields accordingly
- Triggers appropriate change events for dynamic field visibility
- Shows notification when data is successfully carried over

#### `showPrefilledDataNotification()`
- Displays a green notification confirming data retention
- Uses smooth slide animations
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds

### CSS Additions
Added new keyframe animations for the notification:
- `slideDown`: Notification slides down from top
- `slideUp`: Notification slides up and disappears

## Usage Flow

1. **User fills availability form** with booking type, guest count, and dates
2. **User searches for availability** and sees available cottages
3. **User clicks "Book Now"** on any cottage
4. **System automatically**:
   - Clears personal information fields
   - Pre-fills booking type, dates, and guest count
   - Selects the chosen cottage type
   - Shows confirmation notification
5. **User completes booking** with only personal details needed

## Testing

A test file `test-booking-data-retention.html` has been created to verify the functionality:
- Simulates the availability form
- Tests data retention for different cottage types
- Provides clear expected results

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Reduces form re-entry
2. **Faster Booking Process**: Streamlines the conversion from search to booking
3. **Reduced Errors**: Less chance of data entry mistakes
4. **Consistent Data**: Ensures search criteria match booking details

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers
- Uses standard DOM APIs and CSS animations
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Future Enhancements
- Could extend to remember user preferences across sessions
- Could add option to save frequently used booking configurations
- Could implement smart defaults based on user history
